A simple note-taking app for Android, with an emphasis on privacy and security.

The main feature of the app is security of the user's notes, using [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/) for encrypted storage of notes and [CacheWord](https://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword) for securely handling user credentials (passwords) and storage encryption keys. 

## Note on Security

Although Freeword is intended to offer privacy and security to its users, it should not currently be regarded as secure. It has been developed in my free time and has not been reviewed or audited by anyone. It may well have seriously security flaws. Please take this warning seriously!
